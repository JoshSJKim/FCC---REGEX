Regular Expressions

- Regular expressions (regex) are used in programming languages to match parts of strings.
- It is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.
- It is used to check if a string contains specified patters, or to find and replace parts of a string that match the pattern.
- Regex can be used in various programming languages to perform pattern matching and manipulation

## Using the Test Method

- If you want to find the word 'the' in this current sentence, ````/the/``` can be used as the regular expression.
- ```""``` quotation marks are not required within the regular expression.

- One way of testing the regex is the ```.test()``` method.
  - It applies the regex to a string variable (passed in the parentheses).
  - It then returns ```true``` or ```false``` based on the test results.

```js
let myString = "Hello, World!";
let myRegex = /Hello/;
let result = myRegex.test(myString);    // This is the .text() method

console.log(myRegex.test(myString));    // console will display 'true'
```
